# Hello world!
Reading documentation and following tutorials!  
Currently following the [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) tutorial. I hope to learn the fundamentals well, and know about all features of GitHub.

Also used it to practice uploading files as in [Uploading a project to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/uploading-a-project-to-github).
